If you hit the ball, you run around the bases (there are 4 bases that make a diamond shape)\n4. You score a point (called a \"run\") when you run all the way around and touch home plate\n5. If you hit the ball and the other team catches it, you're out\n6. You get three tries (called \"strikes\") to hit the ball before you're out\n7. After three outs, the teams switch - the batting team goes to the field, and the fielding team gets to bat\n8. The game has 9 turns (called \"innings\") for each team\n9.

The larger dog is also wearing a mask with a dog print pattern on it, adding an extra layer of whimsy.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/shame_plant", "generation": "This appears to be Mimosa pudica, also known as the sensitive plant, touch-me-not, or shy plant. What makes this plant special is its unique defensive mechanism - its leaves and stems rapidly fold and droop when touched, shaken, or exposed to heat. This movement, called seismonastic movement or thigmonasty, is one of the fastest reactions known in the plant kingdom.\n\nThe image shows its distinctive pink, fluffy-looking flowers that resemble powder puffs. These flowers are actually made up of many tiny stamens that give it this feathery appearance. The plant is also known for its compound leaves (though not clearly visible in this image) that demonstrate the famous touch-sensitive response.\n\nThis plant has various traditional medicinal uses in many cultures and is considered both an interesting ornamental plant due to its interactive nature and, in some regions, an invasive species due to its rapid growth and spread. The rapid movement response is believed to be a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it also helps the plant conserve water and protect itself during storms."}

This would strengthen Black's position and remove White's potential eye space in that area. The move is particularly important as it helps secure Black's territory while reducing White's potential territory. After capturing this stone, Black's position will be more solid and connected.\n\nThe reason this is optimal is that:\n1. It captures a white stone immediately\n2. It strengthens Black's wall\n3. It prevents White from making eye shape in this area\n4. It maintains Black's territorial advantage in this region\n\nAfter this capture, Black will have a more secure position and better prospects for territory on this side of the board."}

Any graph containing K3,3 as a subgraph cannot be planar. In this case, we have exactly K3,3, so it's definitely non-planar.\n\nTo be planar, a graph must be able to be drawn on a plane with no edge crossings.

None of these medications appear to be specifically designed as sleep aids, and using medications incorrectly can be dangerous.\n\nIf you're having trouble sleeping, it's best to:\n1. Consult with a doctor who can properly diagnose your sleep issues\n2. Try natural solutions first, such as:\n   - Maintaining a regular sleep schedule\n   - Avoiding screens before bedtime\n   - Creating a relaxing bedtime routine\n   - Avoiding caffeine late in the day\n   - Getting regular exercise (but not too close to bedtime)\n   - Making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet and cool\n\nIf sleep problems persist, a healthcare provider can recommend appropriate treatment options and determine if sleep medication is necessary. They can also identify any underlying conditions that might be affecting your sleep."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/fish", "generation": "According to the control panel of this Tower air fryer, for cooking fish, you should:\n\n1. Set the temperature to 180\u00b0C (as indicated by the fish symbol at the top of the panel)\n2. Set the timer for 12-20 minutes (as shown under the fish symbol)\n\nTo operate:\n1. Use the bottom TEMP dial to set the temperature to 180\u00b0C\n2. Use the center TIME dial to set your desired cooking time between 12-20 minutes (depending on the size and thickness of your fish)\n3. The \"WORKING\" and \"POWER\" indicators will light up when the machine is operating\n\nMake sure to:\n- Preheat the air fryer if recommended in your recipe\n- Place the fish in the basket without overcrowding\n- Consider flipping the fish halfway through cooking for even results\n\nThe exact cooking time will depend on the size and thickness of your fish, so you might want to check it at the 12-minute mark to ensure it's not overcooked."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/xbox", "generation": "From the photo, I can see what appears to be an Xbox Series S (the white, rectangular console). It looks like it's plugged in, but I notice that the power cable is connected to something else not fully visible in the image. To troubleshoot:\n\n1. Make sure the power cable is properly and directly connected to a wall outlet (not just a power strip)\n2. Check if the power cable is firmly inserted into the back of the Xbox\n3. Try a different wall outlet\n4. Look for the power button and ensure you're pressing it correctly (it's a physical button on the Series S)\n5. If there's no response at all (no lights, no sounds), the power supply unit inside the console might be faulty\n6. Try unplugging the console completely for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in\n\nIf none of these steps work, you might need to contact Xbox Support as there could be an internal hardware issue."}

There's also a travel adapter shown in the image (the black cube with USA/UK/EU markings).\n\nThe solution would be to:\n1. Use the travel adapter - plug your Apple charger into the appropriate slot on the travel adapter, then plug the travel adapter into the UK power strip\n2. Alternatively, you could purchase a UK-specific cable/adapter that's compatible with your Apple power brick - these are often available as separate replacement cables\n\nThe travel adapter you already have seems to be the quickest solution since it's right there in the image."}

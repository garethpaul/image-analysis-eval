The field is brightly lit and you can see the players on the diamond - the batter at home plate, fielders at their positions, and a pitcher on the mound getting ready to throw the ball.\n\nThe basic rules of baseball that an 8-year-old could understand are:\n\nThere are two teams and they take turns batting and fielding. When batting, the goal is to hit the ball that the pitcher throws and run around the bases to score runs. There are 4 bases that make a square - 1st base, 2nd base, 3rd base, and home plate where you start and finish to score a run.\n\nWhen fielding, the defending team tries to get the batting team \"out\". You can get them out by either catching a batted ball in the air, tagging a base runner with the ball when they aren't on a base, or throwing to 1st base before the batter runs there after hitting the ball.\n\nAfter 3 outs, the teams switch - the batting team goes to field and the fielding team comes in to bat. Whoever scores the most runs after 9 \"innings\" (times they each bat) is the winner!\n\nThe big crowd is watching and cheering on their favorite team under the bright stadium lights. Going to a professional baseball game is an exciting experience for fans of all ages. The goal is simply to outscore your opponent and have a great time at the ballpark!"}

A few key details that help identify the location:\n\n- The Venetian-style architecture with arched bridges over canals is a signature look of The Venetian resort which aims to recreate the appearance of Venice, Italy.\n- The building signage displays \"The Venetian\".\n- The resort hotel name banners featuring photos of a smiling woman, likely a celebrity entertainer.\n- The large neon \"Harrah's\" sign visible in the background, which is another major Las Vegas casino adjacent to The Venetian.\n\nSo in summary, while designed to evoke Venice, all the context clues point to this being the famous Venetian resort located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. The indoor canals and gondolas are one of its most recognizable features."}

The signs instruct visitors to use the cleaning station when entering and exiting the forest to clean their footwear. This helps remove any soil or debris that could potentially carry spores of the disease that is killing kauri trees.\n\nBy providing a footwear cleaning station and clear signage, the park is aiming to get hikers and visitors to take responsibility for helping protect the health of the kauri trees by not inadvertently spreading the harmful pathogen on contaminated shoes or boots as they walk through the forest. It's an example of an environmental protection measure to combat a specific threat to an important tree species in the local ecosystem."}

It's an unexpected and irreverent combination that could be seen as poking fun at politics or government.\n\nSo in summary, it's a novelty shot glass featuring the name and likeness of the Polish parliament, creating a funny contrast between a formal government institution and the casual, party-related connotations of a shot glass. The humor plays on this amusing mismatch of solemn versus irreverent contexts."}

It's poking fun at how immersive and consuming virtual reality can be, jokingly equating it to a drug high that even the \"dealer\" avoids partaking in.\n\nThe meme is a witty, tongue-in-cheek commentary on the addictive nature of captivating technologies like VR and how the people creating or providing them may keep a certain distance, even as enthusiastic users dive in deeply. Of course, it's not literally suggesting VR is like dealing drugs - it's just using that metaphor for humorous effect."}

The final panel shows SpongeBob with a crazed look, engulfed in flames, suggesting an exaggerated or irrational response.\n\nTo use this meme template, you would typically fill in the blank sign in the first panel with an opinion or situation, and the subsequent panels would show SpongeBob's comically overblown negative reaction to it. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of a relatively mild statement with SpongeBob's disproportionately intense response. This style of meme is often used to poke fun at controversial opinions, fandom disagreements, or relatable everyday annoyances by exaggerating them to an absurd degree."}

The humor often comes from the exaggerated comparison and the silly depiction of the muscular dog.\n\nAs with any meme, make sure to use it in a lighthearted, inoffensive way that your audience will understand and appreciate.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/resistors", "generation": "The equivalent resistance between the two marked nodes in this infinite 2D resistor lattice is approximately 0.5 ohms, or R/2.\n\nThis famous problem can be solved using superposition and symmetry arguments. By treating the marked nodes as a source and sink, the resistance looking \"right\" from a node equals the resistance looking \"left\" by symmetry. The same applies vertically, allowing the lattice to be reduced to parallel combinations of series resistors that works out to half the individual resistor value R in the limit of an infinite grid.\n\nSo for ideal 1 ohm resistors, the equivalent resistance between two adjacent nodes in the infinite 2D lattice is 0.5 ohms."}

Eucerin Sun Fluid SPF 50+ - After cleansing, apply this sun protection fluid to protect your skin from harmful UV rays during the day.\n\n3. IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream - This color-correcting full coverage cream can serve as your daytime moisturizer, anti-aging serum, and light foundation all in one. Apply it after your sunscreen.\n\nI would advise skipping the Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant in your morning routine. Chemical exfoliants like BHA can increase sun sensitivity, so it's generally best to use them at night. Stick to just cleansing, sun protection, and a CC cream or light moisturizer in the morning.\n\nAlso, the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant exfoliating powder is better suited for evening use a few times a week rather than daily in the morning. Over-exfoliating, especially in the morning, can irritate your skin.\n\nIn summary - cleanse, apply sunscreen, then use the CC cream in the morning. Save the exfoliating products for nighttime use to avoid sun sensitivity. Always listen to your skin and adjust if you experience any irritation or dryness."}

A clique is a complete subgraph where every node is directly connected to every other node. Currently, node 1 is not directly connected to node 4, and node 2 is not directly connected to node 3. Adding those two missing edges would result in a complete 4-node clique where each node has a direct connection to all other nodes in the graph."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/euler", "generation": "Yes, it is possible to find an Euler path in this graph. Here is one possible Euler path, traversing the nodes in this order:\n\nA - D - E - C - B - A - B - D\n\nThe key observations are:\n1. Nodes A and D have odd degrees (3 edges each), while nodes B, C, and E have even degrees (2 edges each).\n2. Since there are exactly two nodes with odd degree, an Euler path is possible, starting at one of the odd degree nodes and ending at the other.\n\nSo starting at A, then moving to D, E, C, B, back to A, then B again, and finally ending the path at D traverses each edge exactly once, forming a valid Euler path."}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/power_strip", "generation": "Based on the image, it looks like you're trying to plug a large AC adapter or \"wall wart\" into a power strip that has the outlets spaced too closely together to accommodate its size.\n\nA few options to consider:\n\n1. Use a power strip with more widely spaced outlets designed to handle larger plugs and adapters.\n\n2. Get a short extension cord to plug into the power strip, which will allow you to connect the large AC adapter.\n\n3. See if you can rearrange the plugs already in the power strip to make room, perhaps by moving smaller plugs to the ends.\n\n4. As a last resort, you could carefully trim away some of the plastic housing on the adapter (avoiding any circuitry) to make it fit, but this isn't generally advisable unless you're confident in your ability to do it safely.\n\nThe easiest solution is probably to use a power strip with outlets spaced farther apart or a short extension cord. This will let you safely power your device without damaging the adapter or risking electrical issues from a too-crowded power strip."}

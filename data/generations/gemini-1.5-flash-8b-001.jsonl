Adjust the value (e.g., `space-x-4`) for more or less space.\n* **`p-2`:** Adds padding around the buttons for visual separation. Adjust as needed.\n* **`bg-gray-800`:** Sets a dark background color, matching the theme of the image.  Adjust this if your theme is different.\n* **`rounded-lg`:** Adds a rounded corner for visual appeal.\n* **`hover:bg-gray-600`**: Makes the button subtly change color when hovered.\n* **`focus:outline-none`**: Removes the default browser focus outline, which can be distracting.\n* **`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`:** Adds a subtle blue ring when the button is focused, improving accessibility.\n* **`button` element:** Using a `<button>` element is essential for semantic correctness and proper accessibility.\n* **`text-2xl`:**  Makes the icons a larger size.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/code2", "generation": "The code will draw a regular pentagon.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. **`clean`**: Clears the canvas.\n2. **`setxy 0 0`**: Positions the turtle at coordinates (0, 0).\n3. **`pen down`**:  Makes the pen draw.\n4. **`repeat 5`**:  This is the key.  The code inside the repeat block will be executed 5 times.\n5. **`forward 100`**: Moves the turtle forward 100 units.\n6. **`right 144`**: Turns the turtle 144 degrees to the right.\n\nThis sequence of moving forward and turning right by 144 degrees creates a regular pentagon.  A full circle is 360 degrees, so 360/5 = 72 degrees.  The 144-degree turn is equivalent to five 72-degree turns (144 * 5 = 720, which is 2 full rotations + 0 degrees) because 5 * 144 gives the angle needed to close the shape exactly. \n"}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/code3", "generation": "```mathematica\nManipulate[\n Plot[A*Sin[w*(x + phase)], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],\n {{A, 1}, 0.1, 2, Appearance -> \"Labeled\"},\n {{w, 1}, 0.1, 2, Appearance -> \"Labeled\"},\n {{phase, 0}, 0, 2 Pi, Appearance -> \"Labeled\"},\n ControlPlacement -> Top\n]\n```\n\n**Explanation and Improvements:**\n\n* **Amplitude (A):**  The `A` variable controls the amplitude.  The `Manipulate` function now allows the user to adjust this value interactively from 0.1 to 2.   This is important because a sine wave's height is determined by its amplitude.  The `Appearance -> \"Labeled\"` makes it clear what the control does.\n\n* **Frequency (w):** The `w` variable controls the frequency (how many cycles occur in the interval of 2\u03c0).  The manipulation now allows adjustment from 0.1 to 2, enabling you to observe how the shape changes as you increase or decrease the frequency.  Again, `Appearance -> \"Labeled\"` improves clarity.\n\n* **Phase (phase):** The `phase` variable, representing the horizontal shift, still works as designed.\n\n* **Plot Range:** The `Plot` function automatically adjusts the y-axis limits to fit the graph.  The x-axis is still set to 0 to 2\u03c0 which is the default period for the sine function.\n\n* **Control Placement:** The `ControlPlacement -> Top` places the controls at the top of the graph, making the manipulation more user-friendly.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Copy and paste this code into a Mathematica notebook.\n2. Run the code.\n3. You'll see a plot of `Sin[x]`.\n4. Use the sliders to adjust the amplitude (`A`), the frequency (`w`), and the phase (`phase`) to see how the graph changes.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Frequency (w):**  The original plot likely showed the sine wave repeating from 0 to 2\u03c0 exactly one time.  A frequency greater than 1 causes the wave to repeat more often within that range.\n\n* **Amplitude and Frequency Limits:**  The `{{A, 1}, ...}` and `{{w, 1}, ...}`  specify the range of slider values. You might want to adjust these if you need a wider range of amplitudes or frequencies.\n\n* **Phase:**  The phase in radians controls horizontal shifting of the sine wave.\n\n\nThis improved code provides a much more flexible way to explore the effects of amplitude, frequency, and phase on a sine wave. You can now easily visualize how these parameters impact the shape and behavior of the graph. Remember to save this code in a notebook cell for future use and experimentation."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/code4", "generation": "```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data (replace with your actual data)\ndata = np.random.rand(32, 32) * 0.75 - 0.375\n\n# Create the heatmap\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\nim = ax.imshow(data, cmap='coolwarm', interpolation='nearest', vmin=-0.75, vmax=0.75)\n\n# Add colorbar\ncbar = ax.figure.colorbar(im, ax=ax)\ncbar.ax.set_ylabel('Value', rotation=-90, va=\"bottom\")\n\n# Set axis labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('X')\nax.set_ylabel('Y')\nax.set_title('Heatmap')\n\n\n# Set ticks and labels for clarity, especially for larger grids\nx_ticks = np.arange(0, 32, 5)  # Adjust step for better spacing\ny_ticks = np.arange(0, 32, 5)\n\nax.set_xticks(x_ticks)\nax.set_yticks(y_ticks)\nax.set_xticklabels(x_ticks)\nax.set_yticklabels(y_ticks)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Explanation and Improvements:**\n\n1. **Data Generation:** The code now generates sample data using `np.random.rand(32, 32)`.  Critically, it scales this data to the range [-0.75, 0.75] which matches the colorbar. Replace this with your actual data.  **Crucial:** Your data must be a 2D numpy array.\n\n\n2. **Colormap:** It uses the 'coolwarm' colormap for a good visual contrast.\n\n\n3. **Colorbar:**  The colorbar is correctly added and labeled.\n\n\n4. **`vmin` and `vmax`:**  These are essential to control the color scale to match your colorbar. This is how you precisely map values to colors.\n\n\n5. **Interpolation:** `interpolation='nearest'` creates the pixelated effect like in your image (important for heatmaps)\n\n\n6. **Axis Labels and Title:**  Labels and title are added for clarity.\n\n\n7. **Axis Ticks and Labels (crucial for clarity):** The code now sets the x and y ticks to meaningful values (every 5 units), preventing the ticks from overlapping too much or being too dense.  It also sets the tick labels to match the ticks. This greatly improves the readability of the plot for larger datasets.\n\n\n**How to Use with Your Data:**\n\n1. **Replace the sample data:**\n   ```python\n   # Load your data into a NumPy array named 'data'.\n   # Example:\n   import pandas as pd\n   df = pd.read_csv(\"your_data.csv\")\n   data = df.values\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust `vmin` and `vmax`:** Ensure your data's min and max values match the expected colorbar range.\n\n3. **Adjust the `figsize` (optional):** Modify the `figsize` parameter in `plt.subplots` to change the size of the plot if needed.\n\n\nThis revised code will produce a heatmap that accurately reflects your data and matches the visual style of the provided image.

The meme repurposes this to represent how a large language model (LLM) like Reka Core might have access to a pre-existing dataset (Vibe Check) that covers certain topics or styles. Thus, the LLM is not actually creating something entirely new, but rather drawing on pre-existing material.\n\nThe humor comes from the juxtaposition of the LLM's potential capabilities with the child's innocent and seemingly incredulous reaction to the idea that something is \"brand new,\" highlighting the idea that \"new\" things are often just rehashed variations of prior concepts.\n"}

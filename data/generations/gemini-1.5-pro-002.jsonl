A video would be much more helpful. However, I can offer some general observations and things to consider based on the picture:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **You're planing:** The board is clearly out of the water and skimming the surface, indicating good speed and control.\n* **Harness engaged:** It looks like you're hooked into your harness, which is essential for prolonged planing and less fatigue.\n* **Sail position:**  The sail seems to be relatively well-positioned, although it's hard to be certain without seeing the whole rig and your body position relative to the wind.\n\n**Potential areas for improvement (remember, these are just guesses based on limited information):**\n\n* **Back leg:** Your back leg appears quite straight.  A more bent back leg, with your weight centered over the board, could improve your balance and control, especially in choppy conditions.  This also helps with absorbing gusts and maintaining a consistent plane.\n* **Front arm:**  Hard to tell from the angle, but your front arm might be a bit straight. A slight bend in the front arm can give you more feel for the sail and improve your responsiveness.\n* **Overall stance:** It's hard to judge your stance from this angle, but aim for a comfortable athletic position with a slight bend in both knees and your weight centered.\n\n**To get better feedback, consider:**\n\n* **Posting a video:** A short video of you sailing would allow for much more detailed analysis of your technique.\n* **Specifying what you want feedback on:**  Are you working on a specific skill, like faster planing, gybing, or waterstarts?  Knowing your goals helps tailor the feedback.\n* **Providing context:**  What are the wind and water conditions?  What kind of board and sail are you using?  This information can also be helpful.\n\nKeep practicing and having fun! Windsurfing takes time and dedication, but it's incredibly rewarding.\n"}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/meme7", "generation": "This SpongeBob meme template, often called \"Mocking SpongeBob\" or \"SpongeBob's Confused Reaction,\" is used to express skepticism, disbelief, or mockery of an idea or situation.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Panel 1: Blank Sign:** This panel is where you introduce the initial idea, concept, or statement that will be ridiculed. You write this on the blank sign.  It can be text, an image, or a combination of both.\n\n2. **Panel 2: Reading:** SpongeBob is reading the sign/idea.  This panel sets the stage for the reaction.\n\n3. **Panel 3: Crumpling/Burning:**  SpongeBob starts to reject the idea. He either crumples the paper (a milder form of rejection) or sets it on fire (for stronger disapproval).\n\n4. **Panel 4: Waving Away:** SpongeBob completely dismisses the idea by waving away the ashes or crumpled paper.  This represents the final mockery or disdain for the original concept.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Panel 1 (Sign):** \"Getting 8 hours of sleep every night is essential for good health.\" (This is the target of the mockery)\n\n* **Panel 2 (Reading):** SpongeBob reading the sign.\n\n* **Panel 3 (Burning):** SpongeBob sets the sign on fire.\n\n* **Panel 4 (Waving Away):** SpongeBob waves away the ashes, implying that the idea of getting 8 hours of sleep is unrealistic or ridiculous (from the perspective of someone who doesn't get enough sleep).\n\n\nThe humor comes from the contrast between the often seemingly reasonable initial statement and SpongeBob's exaggerated, dismissive reaction. The more absurd the contrast, the funnier the meme becomes.\n"}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/meme6", "generation": "This meme uses a scene from the movie *Back to the Future*. It humorously portrays Reka Core (a large language model or LLM) as Marty McFly, and the \"Vibe Check\" dataset (used to evaluate LLMs) as something Marty has supposedly seen before.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the humor:\n\n* **Marty/Reka Core claiming to have \"seen this one\":** This represents Reka Core, like other LLMs, being trained on massive datasets.  It implies that Reka Core has already encountered similar data during its training, suggesting a potential limitation in the novelty of the Vibe Check dataset.  Like Marty encountering something that's supposed to be new but feels familiar because of time travel shenanigans, the LLM might find the \"Vibe Check\" predictable due to prior exposure to similar information in its training data.\n\n* **The younger siblings' confusion:** The other characters' questioning of Marty's statement (\"What do you mean you've seen it? It's brand new!\") mirrors the surprise one might have at an LLM seemingly recognizing or predicting patterns within a supposedly new and unique dataset. It underlines the sometimes uncanny ability of LLMs to appear knowledgeable about things they shouldn't have directly encountered.\n\n* **\"Vibe Check\" as something tangible:**  The meme treats the abstract concept of a dataset like a physical object that Marty/Reka Core could have \"seen\" before. This adds to the humorous absurdity of the situation.\n\nIn essence, the meme jokes about the potential for data redundancy in LLM training, and the seemingly paradoxical ability of LLMs to appear familiar with \"new\" information. It plays on the idea that even a specialized dataset designed to evaluate an LLM like Reka Core might not be entirely \"new\" to the model due to the vastness of its training data.\n"}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/meme9", "generation": "This meme humorously depicts different ways of learning Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), comparing the perceived level of understanding gained from each.  It uses the expanding brain meme to illustrate increasingly profound enlightenment.\n\n* **Learning ML/DL from University:** Shows a dimly lit brain, suggesting a basic, foundational understanding.  The implication is that while universities provide a good starting point, they might not offer the most practical or up-to-date knowledge.\n\n* **Online Courses:** The brain is brighter, indicating a more developed understanding compared to university learning. This acknowledges the value and accessibility of online courses in expanding one's knowledge.\n\n* **From YouTube:**  The brain is even brighter, hinting at a more practical and visual learning experience that YouTube tutorials often provide.\n\n* **From Articles:**  The brain glows intensely, signifying a deeper, more comprehensive understanding gleaned from in-depth research and study of academic papers or technical articles.\n\n* **From Memes:**  The brain is not just glowing, but it's radiating light and the figure is now depicted in a meditative, enlightened pose. This is a hyperbolic, ironic take.  It jokes that the simple, digestible, and often humorous nature of memes somehow unlocks a transcendent level of understanding, surpassing even dedicated study.  Of course, this is not true, but the humor comes from the unexpected and exaggerated leap in \"enlightenment.\"\n\nIn essence, the meme satirizes the different learning pathways while playfully suggesting that memes, despite their seemingly superficial nature, can sometimes offer surprising insights or make complex topics more approachable.  It's a relatable sentiment for those in the field who appreciate both rigorous study and the occasional humorous take on the subject matter.\n"}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/resistors", "generation": "Let the two blue vertices be A and B.\nLet the current injected at A be $I$. By symmetry, the current splits into four branches, each with current $I/4$.\nThe voltage drop from A to the next vertex in the direction of B is $IR/4$. The voltage drop across the vertical resistor connecting A to the vertex above it is zero, because there is no current flowing in that resistor.\nSimilarly, the current leaving B is $I$. By symmetry, it comes from four branches, each with current $I/4$.\nThe voltage drop from the vertex left of B to B is $IR/4$.\nConsider the vertex between the two blue vertices. The voltage at that point is $V_A + IR/4 = V_B - IR/4$, so the voltage drop across the central resistor is $V_B - V_A = 2IR/4 = IR/2$.\nLet $V$ be the voltage difference between the blue nodes.\nThen the current flowing through the central resistor is $V/R = V/1 = V$.\nThe current flowing from A to B is $I/4 + V + I/4 = I/2 + V$.\nThe equivalent resistance between the blue vertices is\n$R_{eq} = V/I = \\frac{I - I/2}{I} = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$.\n\nConsider the superposition principle. Inject current $I$ at A and extract it at B.\nAlso inject current $I$ at B and extract it at A.\nBy symmetry, the voltage between A and B is $V$ in the first case and $-V$ in the second case.\nBy superposition, the total voltage between A and B is $2V$.\nThe total current injected at A is $2I$, and the total current injected at B is $-2I$.\nThus the equivalent resistance between A and B is $\\frac{2V}{2I} = V/I = 1/2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1/2}$"}

Is this Hong Kong style, Taiwanese, American, or something else?  The tile set itself gives some clues, but doesn't definitively specify the rules.\n* **Your intended winning hand:** Are you going for a specific hand type?

The new tile often heavily influences the best discard.\n\n**General advice (assuming some common mahjong principles):**\n\n* **Pairs are valuable:**  You have a pair of One Bamboos. Keep these.\n* **Chows/Runs are good:** You have some potential for runs in bamboo and characters.  Consider keeping tiles that could form these (e.g., Two or Three Bamboo, Five or Seven Character).\n* **Avoid isolated tiles:** Tiles that don't seem to fit with any potential combinations are usually good candidates for discarding.\n* **Consider the wind:** You don't seem to have any wind tiles (East, South, West, North) in your hand.

Over-exfoliating can damage your skin barrier.  If you use this in the morning, wait a few minutes for it to absorb before applying other products.\n3. **IT Cosmetics CC+ Illumination Cream:** This product acts as a serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, and makeup all in one. *However, with an SPF of 50, it is sufficient sun protection, so you don't need a separate sunscreen.*\n4. *Optional:*  If using makeup, apply it after the CC cream.\n\n**Evening Routine:**\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser:** Remove makeup and cleanse your skin.\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant:** (If you didn't use it in the morning, and are following the 2-3 times weekly usage).\n3. **Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner:** This is applied after cleansing and exfoliating.\n4. *Optional*: Serum or treatment, if you use one.\n\n**Things to avoid in the morning routine from the products you listed:**\n\n* **Eucerin Photoaging Control Sun Fluid SPF 50:** Avoid layering sunscreens. Since the IT Cosmetics CC+ cream already has SPF 50, using this would be redundant and could feel heavy.\n* **Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner:**  Toners are generally used after cleansing to balance the skin's pH, but you can skip it in the morning, especially if you're using a hydrating product like the CC cream.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Patch Test:** If you're introducing new products to your routine, start with a patch test to ensure you don't have a negative reaction.\n* **Listen to Your Skin:**  Skincare isn't one-size-fits-all. Adjust your routine based on your skin's needs and how it responds to the products.  If your skin feels irritated or dry, cut back on the exfoliant or use it less frequently.\n\n\n"}

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for BBC specifically, or for all sites.\n3. **Update Browser:** Ensure your browser is up to date.\n4. **Disable Browser Extensions (Temporarily):** Some browser extensions might be interfering with cookies.

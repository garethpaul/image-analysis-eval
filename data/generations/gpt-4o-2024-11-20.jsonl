Knead until smooth and elastic (around 8\u201310 minutes).  \n   - Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise for 1\u20132 hours or until it doubles in size.  \n\n2. **Prepare Toppings:**  \n   - While the dough rises, make the tomato sauce by blending canned tomatoes and seasoning lightly.  \n   - Tear mozzarella into chunks.  \n\n3. **Shape the Dough:**  \n   - Preheat your oven to the highest setting (450\u00b0F/230\u00b0C or higher). If using a pizza stone, heat it in the oven.  \n   - Divide the dough into portions, shape them into rounds, and gently stretch out into a pizza base using your hands.\n\n4. **Assemble the Pizza:**  \n   - Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the base.  \n   - Add mozzarella pieces evenly across the surface.  \n   - Place fresh basil leaves on top.  \n\n5. **Bake the Pizza:**  \n   - If you have a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the stone, or use a baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 7\u201312 minutes until the crust is golden, and the cheese is melted and bubbling.  \n   - Drizzle with olive oil before serving.  \n\nEnjoy your Margherita pizza! \ud83c\udf55"}

It's often associated with irritation, acid exposure, infection, or other causes.\n\n### Should you be concerned?\n- These findings are not uncommon and are manageable under medical supervision.\n- **Barrett's esophagus** requires regular **monitoring (e.g., endoscopy)** as it slightly elevates the risk of esophageal cancer, but early detection ensures timely intervention if changes occur.\n- **Erythematous mucosa** can often be addressed by treating underlying conditions like GERD, acid reflux, or inflammation.\n\n### What to do:\n- **Follow up with your doctor:** Discuss these results, their implications, and next steps for treatment and monitoring.\n- **Maintain a healthy lifestyle:** Manage acid reflux through dietary changes, weight management, and avoiding triggers like alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods.\n- **Medication (if prescribed):** If you have GERD, your doctor may prescribe medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce stomach acid and protect the esophageal lining.\n\nIt\u2019s great that this was identified, as proactive management significantly reduces risks.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc22", "generation": "This is a **Back Lever**, a skill often performed in gymnastics and calisthenics on the rings or bar. Here's some insight into the move and evaluation of the performance in the image:\n\n### What is a Back Lever?\n- The Back Lever is an **isometric skill** where the body is held parallel to the ground, facing downward, supported by the arms on the rings or bar.\n- It requires significant **shoulder extension strength, core stability, and body tension**.\n\n---\n\n### Difficulty Rating:\n- **FIG Men's Artistic Gymnastics Code of Points**: The Back Lever is considered an **A-rated skill**, which is the lowest difficulty rating in gymnastics. However, it's a foundational move and still challenging, especially for beginners.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\nFrom the image:\n1. **Body Alignment**:\n   - The person's body appears slightly curved. Ideally, the body should be in a straight line from shoulders to toes.\n   - There might be some arching in the lower back, which would indicate the need for better core engagement.\n\n2. **Arm Position**:\n   - The arms seem to be holding the rings properly with straight elbows, which is essential for proper form.\n\n3. **Shoulder Position**:\n   - The shoulders seem sufficiently extended and stable\u2014they are in the correct position to balance the move.\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Core Engagement**: The athlete should activate the core more to ensure the body remains in a straight line.\n- **Leg Position**: The feet and legs should be fully extended and pointed to increase form and aesthetics.\n- **Overall Form**: Slight adjustments in posture (eliminating any arch) can take the move closer to perfection.\n\nIn summary: While it appears the move is being performed reasonably well, slight improvements in posture, particularly body alignment, would make the execution flawless!"}

Try to put more weight on your back foot while keeping your knees slightly bent to absorb the movements of the water.\n   - Your front leg seems to be pointing upward, possibly indicating a recovery attempt. Focus on keeping your body aligned with the board and sail to maintain control.\n\n2. **Sail Handling:**\n   - Make sure you're holding the boom firmly but not too stiffly. Keep your arms extended slightly to allow smooth control of the sail\u2019s power.\n   - Lean back slightly and let the harness absorb more of the sail's pull to reduce strain on your arms.\n\n3. **Foot Placement:**\n   - Your feet should ideally be positioned between the foot straps during maneuvers or in the straps during planing. If your feet are coming off, try to focus on planting them securely for stability.\n\n4. **Practice Jibes or Tacks:**\n   - From the photo, it looks like you might be attempting a turn or recovering. If practicing jibes, work on leaning and shifting your weight smoothly without interrupting the sail's pull.\n\n5. **Safety:**\n   - If you\u2019re losing grip or balance often, consider practicing in less gusty conditions or on a slightly larger, more stable board.\n   - Check your harness fit to ensure it\u2019s supporting you effectively.\n\nWith more practice, these balance and control elements will become second nature.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **The Image**: It shows one person walking confidently in casual clothing amid a crowd of people wearing VR (virtual reality) headsets, who appear absorbed in their experiences.\n- **Caption**: \"A drug dealer never consumes!\" This phrase humorously compares the role of a powerful tech figure (possibly a founder or CEO) to a \"dealer\" offering addictive products but not partaking themselves.\n  \n### What it implies:\n1. **The \"Dealer\"**: The person walking symbolizes a tech leader or influencer who profits from creating products that captivate users (e.g., social media platforms, virtual reality experiences).\n2. **The \"Consumers\"**: The audience wearing VR headsets symbolizes society's immersion or possible addiction to these technologies, often designed to be engaging and all-consuming.\n3. **The Satire**: The caption suggests irony\u2014while tech leaders create highly engaging products, they often maintain a level of detachment from overusing them, knowing their risks or implications.\n\nEssentially, it's a critique of how certain industries profit from mass consumption behaviors while remaining separate from the effects they promote, akin to the phrase \"a drug dealer never consumes their own supply.\""}

Instead, use it at night! If you must use it in the morning, follow up with a strong sunscreen and reapply regularly.\n\n4. **CC Cream with SPF (It Cosmetics CC+ Cream with SPF 50+)**\n   - This doubles as makeup and sunscreen, providing coverage and protection from UV damage.\n\n5. **Additional Sunscreen (Eucerin Photoaging Control SPF 50 Sun Fluid)**  \n   - If you aren't using the CC cream or need extra protection, apply this sunscreen. Reapply every 2 hours if you're outdoors for extended periods.\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes:\n- **Avoid BHA Exfoliant in the Morning**: BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Instead, apply the exfoliant at night after cleansing and toning. Use sunscreen religiously if you use exfoliants at all.\n- **Sunscreen Priority**: Always ensure proper application of sunscreen during your morning routine as it protects your skin from sun damage.\n- **Hydration missing**?: If your skin feels dry, consider adding a moisturizer after toning and before the CC cream.\n\n### Adjustments for Best Results\n- Skip the exfoliant in the morning and use it every other night.\n- Ensure adequate sunscreen application to keep your skin safe, especially if using actives like BHA.\n\n"}

The graph must be connected (ignoring isolated vertices, if any).\n2. It must have exactly **two vertices with an odd degree** (precisely two vertices with an odd number of edges).\n\n### Step 1: Compute the degree of each vertex\nFrom the image, we can see:\n- Vertex A has 2 edges.\n- Vertex B has 2 edges.\n- Vertex C has 2 edges.\n- Vertex D has 4 edges.\n- Vertex E has 2 edges.\n\n**Degrees of vertices:**  \n- A: 2 (even)  \n- B: 2 (even)  \n- C: 2 (even)  \n- D: 4 (even)  \n- E: 2 (even)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the degrees\nSince **all vertices have an even degree** and no vertices have an odd degree, it is **not possible** to find an Euler path. Instead, this graph has an **Euler circuit (cycle)** because all vertices have an even degree, and the graph is connected.\n\n**Conclusion:** There is no Euler path (start and end at different vertices), but there is an Euler circuit if needed.

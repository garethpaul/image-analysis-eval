The pitcher from the other team throws the ball, and the batter tries to hit it with a bat.\n\n3. **Running the Bases**: If the batter hits the ball, they run to first base, then to second, third, and back to home plate to score a run. They need to touch each base in order!\n\n4. **Getting Outs**: The fielding team tries to get the batter out by catching the ball in the air after it's hit or touching the base before the runner gets there.\n\n5. **Innings**: The game is played in parts called innings. Each team gets a turn to bat and a turn to field. A game usually has nine innings.\n\n6. **Winning**: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!\n\nSo, baseball is all about hitting, running, and teamwork!

Discard tiles that are least likely to contribute to completing your melds.\n\n3. **Look for Exposed Melds**: If there are tiles that other players have claimed for melds, check if you can use those to complete your own.\n\n4. **Select a Tile to Draw or Discard**: If you're waiting for a specific tile to complete your hand, drawing that tile should be your priority. Alternatively, choose one tile to discard that will least impact your hand's potential.\n\n5. **Keep Track of Opponents' Discards**: This helps you gauge what tiles they might be looking for and influence your decisions on which tiles to keep or discard.\n\nIf you provide more details about your current hand, I could offer more tailored advice!"}

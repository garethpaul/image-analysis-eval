{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc4", "generation": "The image illustrates two types of continuation patterns in technical analysis: the Flag and the Pennant. Here are the differences between them:\n\n1. **Shape:**\n   - **Flag:** The flag pattern resembles a small rectangle or parallelogram. It typically has parallel trend lines that slope against the prevailing trend.\n   - **Pennant:** The pennant pattern looks like a small symmetrical triangle. It converges to a point, forming a triangle shape with converging trend lines.\n\n2. **Formation:**\n   - **Flag:** The flag pattern forms after a strong, nearly vertical price movement, followed by a consolidation period where the price moves sideways or slightly against the trend.\n   - **Pennant:** The pennant pattern also forms after a strong price movement, but the consolidation period sees the price converging into a smaller and smaller range, forming a triangle.\n\n3. **Duration:**\n   - **Flag:** Flags tend to have a shorter duration compared to pennants.\n   - **Pennant:** Pennants can take a bit longer to form due to the converging nature of the pattern.\n\n4. **Volume:**\n   - **Flag:** Volume typically decreases during the formation of the flag and increases again when the price breaks out.\n   - **Pennant:** Volume also decreases during the formation of the pennant and increases upon breakout.\n\n5. **Breakout:**\n   - **Flag:** The breakout from a flag pattern is usually in the direction of the initial strong move.\n   - **Pennant:** Similarly, the breakout from a pennant pattern is also in the direction of the initial strong move.\n\n6. **Psychology:**\n   - **Flag:** The flag pattern represents a brief pause in the market where traders are taking profits, but the overall trend continues once the consolidation ends.\n   - **Pennant:** The pennant pattern indicates a period of consolidation where the market is deciding its next move, often leading to a continuation of the prior trend with increased momentum.\n\nBoth patterns are bullish in the context of the image, indicating a buying opportunity after the breakout. However, the key visual difference lies in their shapes and the way the price consolidates before the breakout."}

Nigiri sushi consists of a slice of raw fish (or other seafood) placed on top of a small ball of vinegared rice. Here's what you see on the plate:\n\n1. **Uni (Sea Urchin)** - The orange piece on the left.\n2. **Salmon** - The pink piece in the middle.\n3. **Ikura (Salmon Roe)** - The red piece on the right with green garnish.\n\nHere's how to eat nigiri sushi:\n\n1. **Use Your Hands or Chopsticks**: Traditionally, sushi is eaten with your hands, but using chopsticks is also acceptable, especially in Western settings.\n\n2. **Pick Up the Sushi**: If using chopsticks, gently pick up the sushi by the rice, not the fish. If using your hands, pick it up gently.\n\n3. **Dip in Soy Sauce**: If you like, you can dip the fish side (not the rice side) into soy sauce. Be careful not to soak the rice in soy sauce as it can become too salty and fall apart.\n\n4. **Add Wasabi**: Some sushi chefs already place a small amount of wasabi between the fish and rice. If not, or if you prefer more, you can add a small amount of wasabi to the fish before dipping it in soy sauce.\n\n5. **Eat in One Bite**: Sushi is typically eaten in one bite to experience the full flavor and texture.\n\n6. **Ginger**: The green item on the plate is pickled ginger. It's used to cleanse your palate between different types of sushi.\n\n7. **Enjoy**: Take a moment to appreciate the flavors and textures. Sushi is meant to be savored.\n\nRemember, sushi etiquette can vary, but the key is to enjoy the meal. If you're new to sushi, you might want to start with milder flavors like salmon before trying more intense flavors like uni or ikura."}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/che-game4", "generation": "In the image, the heroes are from the game \"League of Legends.\" The top hero is Rammus, and the bottom hero is Kha'Zix. \n\nTo determine who would win in a fight, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Levels and Items**: Both heroes are at level 13, but their items and health/mana bars are crucial. Kha'Zix has more health (231/231) compared to Rammus (310/310), but Rammus has more armor and health regeneration due to his passive and items.\n\n2. **Abilities**: \n   - **Rammus**: Known for his defensive capabilities, Rammus can taunt enemies with his ultimate, making them attack him while he gains armor and damage reduction. His abilities also include a speed boost and an area-of-effect damage skill.\n   - **Kha'Zix**: An assassin with high burst damage, Kha'Zix can isolate and quickly kill targets with his abilities, especially if he can evolve his skills for additional effects like invisibility or increased damage.\n\n3. **Gameplay Mechanics**: \n   - **Rammus** can initiate with his taunt, forcing Kha'Zix to attack him, which might not be ideal for Kha'Zix if Rammus has enough armor and health to withstand the initial burst.\n   - **Kha'Zix** relies on his ability to isolate and burst down targets quickly. If he can avoid Rammus's taunt and land his full combo, he might be able to take Rammus down quickly.\n\nGiven the current state in the image:\n- **Rammus** has a significant advantage in terms of survivability due to his armor and health regeneration.\n- **Kha'Zix** needs to land his abilities perfectly and possibly use his ultimate to evolve his skills for maximum damage output.\n\n**Conclusion**: If Rammus can land his taunt and Kha'Zix fails to isolate or burst him down quickly, Rammus would likely win due to his superior defensive stats and ability to sustain in prolonged fights. However, if Kha'Zix can avoid the taunt and execute his combo effectively, he might be able to take down Rammus before he can retaliate significantly. \n\nIn a typical scenario, Rammus would have the upper hand due to his tankiness and crowd control, but in League of Legends, the outcome can heavily depend on player skill, positioning, and timing of abilities."}

Serums are typically applied after cleansing and before moisturizing to allow active ingredients to penetrate the skin.\n\n3. **Moisturizer**: Use the **IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream with SPF 50+**. This product serves as both a moisturizer and a foundation with sun protection.\n\n4. **Sunscreen**: If you need additional sun protection or if the CC cream does not provide enough coverage, you can apply the **Eucerin Daily Protection Face Lotion SPF 50** over the CC cream.\n\n5. **Additional Serum (if needed)**: If you feel your skin needs extra hydration or specific treatment, you can use the **Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50** after the CC cream but before the additional sunscreen.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Avoid Overloading**: Using too many products can overwhelm the skin. If you find your skin is reacting negatively, consider simplifying your routine.\n\n- **Sunscreen**: Since both the CC cream and the Eucerin lotion have SPF 50, you might not need to use both. Choose one based on your preference for coverage and texture.\n\n- **Niacinamide**: The Paula's Choice serum contains niacinamide, which is generally well-tolerated but can cause irritation if overused or if your skin is sensitive. Start with a small amount to see how your skin reacts.\n\n- **Morning Routine**: In the morning, focus on cleansing, hydration, and sun protection. Avoid heavy treatments or exfoliants in the morning as they can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.\n\n- **Product Layering**: Apply products from thinnest to thickest consistency. Serums are usually the thinnest, followed by moisturizers, and then sunscreens or CC creams.\n\n- **Patch Test**: If you haven't used these products before, do a patch test to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction to any of them.\n\nRemember, skincare routines can be personalized based on your skin type and concerns. If you have specific skin issues or conditions, consulting with a dermatologist can provide tailored advice."}

Here are some common issues to check:\n\n1. **Power Supply**: Ensure that the fan is properly plugged into a working electrical outlet. Check if the outlet is functioning by plugging in another device.\n\n2. **Power Switch**: Verify that the power switch on the fan is turned on. Sometimes, the switch might be accidentally turned off.\n\n3. **Fuse or Circuit Breaker**: Check if a fuse has blown or if a circuit breaker has tripped. Reset the breaker or replace the fuse if necessary.\n\n4. **Motor Issues**: The motor might have failed. This could be due to overheating, age, or a manufacturing defect. If the motor is the issue, it might need replacement.\n\n5. **Wiring**: Internal wiring might be loose or disconnected. This would require opening the fan (unplug it first for safety) and checking the connections.\n\n6. **Capacitor**: Some fans have a capacitor that helps start the motor. If this capacitor is faulty, the fan won't start.\n\n7. **Obstructions**: Ensure there are no obstructions in the fan blades or motor housing that could prevent the fan from spinning.\n\n8. **Remote Control or Control Panel**: If your fan has a remote control or a control panel, check the batteries or the panel for any issues.\n\n9. **Mechanical Issues**: The fan might have a mechanical issue like a broken blade or a part that has come loose.\n\n10. **Safety Features**: Some fans have safety features that stop the fan if it detects an issue like overheating or imbalance. Check if any safety feature might have been triggered.\n\nIf you've checked all these and the fan still doesn't work, it might be best to consult with a professional or consider replacing the fan if it's not under warranty."}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/power_strip", "generation": "If your charger doesn't fit into the power strip, here are a few solutions you can try:\n\n1. **Use an Adapter**: If the plug type of your charger is different from the sockets on the power strip, you might need a travel adapter that converts the plug type to fit the power strip.\n\n2. **Check for Blockage**: Ensure that there isn't any obstruction or debris in the socket that might be preventing the plug from fitting. Sometimes, dust or small objects can block the socket.\n\n3. **Try a Different Socket**: If the power strip has multiple sockets, try plugging the charger into a different socket to see if it fits better.\n\n4. **Use an Extension Cord**: If the power strip is too close to the wall or furniture, you might need an extension cord to give you more space to maneuver the plug.\n\n5. **Remove Other Plugs**: If the power strip is too crowded, remove some of the other plugs to give more space for your charger.\n\n6. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that the charger and the power strip are compatible in terms of voltage and plug type.\n\n7. **Use a Different Power Strip**: If none of the above solutions work, consider using a different power strip that has more space or different types of sockets.\n\nIn the image, it looks like the white charger might be too large to fit into the power strip due to its size. You might need to use one of the above solutions to accommodate it."}

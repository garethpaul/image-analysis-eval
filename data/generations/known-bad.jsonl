Its ears are perked up, which usually indicates interest or attention to something. The fact that it's lying on its back could mean it's feeling relaxed and safe in its environment, as this is a vulnerable position for a cat. However, the wide-open eyes and the position of the paws, which are close to the body but not in a defensive posture, suggest that the cat is attentive to something, possibly the person taking the photo. There's no sign of fur standing on end or a hissing mouth, which would indicate fear or anger. Overall, the cat seems to be in a calm but attentive state."}

The `cmap` parameter sets the colormap to use. The `colorbar` function is used to add a colorbar to the plot, which shows the value associated with each color in the heatmap. Finally, the `title` function is used to set the title of the plot."}

Now, let's compare this with the area of the circle on the right, which has a diameter of 2 units. The area of this circle, being \\(\\pi \\times 1^2\\), is approximately \\(\\pi \\approx 3.1415\\).\n\nBased on the area comparison alone, it might seem feasible for the objects to fit inside the circle. However, when considering their arrangement, 2.348 square units is the combined area of the rectangles, not their perimeter. The rectangles cannot be arranged in a way that their combined perimeter equals their combined area.\n\nTherefore, no, the set of objects on the left cannot fit inside the object on the right without overlapping."}

However, they differ in their structure:\n\n1. **Pennant** This pattern is characterized by a period of consolidation where prices move within narrower ranges before resuming the main trend. \n\n2. **Flag**: A Flag is characterized fundamentally differently than a Pennant.  The Flag pattern is a rectangle that slopes with the prevailing trend. The pattern is called a flag because it resembles a flag on a flagpole, where the flagpole is a vertical line that represents a smooth price movement, and the flag is a smaller rectangle that slopes in the opposite direction of the trend.\n\nIn terms of trading, both patterns suggest that a buy signal is expected after the pattern is completed, as indicated by the 'Buy' arrows. The main difference is in their formation and the way they are interpreted: Flags are seen as brief pauses in a trend, while Pennants indicate a brief consolidation after a sharp price movement."}

Since 3 face cards of hearts (King, Queen, and Jack) are already shown, there is only 1 face card of hearts left in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing a face card of hearts next is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1 (the remaining face card of hearts) divided by 49 (52 cards minus the 3 already drawn), resulting in a probability of approximately 0.0204 or 2.04%."}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc17", "generation": "Sure! Baseball is a fun sport that's played between two teams, usually on a big field with lots of green grass. The game has some simple rules:\n\n1. **Teams and Positions**: Each team has nine players who take turns to hit and field. The players have different positions on the field: pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.\n\n2. **Scoring**: The goal is to score more runs than the other team. A run is scored when a player runs around all the bases and goes back to home plate.\n\n3. **Batting**: One team is at bat (hitting) while the other team is in the field. When you're at bat, you try to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher. If you hit the ball and make it to a base without the other team tagging you out, you get a hit.\n\n4. **Bases**: There are four bases on the field: home plate, first base, second base, and third base. You have to run from one base to the next to score a run.\n\n5. **Pitching**: The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter, who tries to hit it. The catcher, who sits behind the batter, catches the balls the batter doesn't hit.\n\n6. **Outs**: There are three ways to get an \"out\": \n   - The batter misses the ball three times.\n   - The batter hits the ball, but the other team catches it before it bounces.\n   - The ball is thrown to a base before the batter gets there, and the fielder tags the base with the ball before the batter steps on it.\n\n7. **Innings**: The game is divided into innings. Each team gets to bat and field once per inning. A standard game usually has nine innings.\n\n8. **Winning**: The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins!\n\nIt's important to play fair and have fun! Enjoy the game!"}

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/resistors", "generation": "To determine the equivalent resistance between the two blue vertices in an infinite grid of resistors, each with resistance \\( R = 1 \\), we can use the symmetry and periodicity of the grid. Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Symmetry:**\n   The infinite grid of resistors is symmetric, meaning any path from the blue vertex to another blue vertex can be mirrored to another path from a different blue vertex.\n\n2. **Path Analysis:**\n   By focusing on one specific path from one blue vertex to another, we can simplify the problem. Given the periodicity, the problem reduces to calculating the resistance along a specific path.\n\n3. **Simplify the Grid:**\n   The grid can be simplified by considering a smaller repeating unit (a 2x2 or 3x3 grid, for instance) and then extending the result to the infinite grid.\n\n4. **Calculate the Resistance:**\n   Using the formula for the equivalent resistance in a resistive grid, we can calculate the resistance between two points in the grid. For an infinite grid of resistors \\( R = 1 \\), the equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\) between two vertices separated by a distance \\( d \\) (in terms of the number of resistors) can be derived from known results in electrical engineering literature.\n\n   For an infinite square lattice of resistors with each resistor \\( R \\), the equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\) between two points separated by a distance \\( d \\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   R_{eq} \\approx \\frac{R}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{d+1}{d} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Here, \\( d \\) is the Manhattan distance between the two points.\n\n5. **Apply the Formula:**\n   For the given problem, \\( R = 1 \\). If the two blue vertices are separated by a distance \\( d \\), we can plug in these values into the formula to get the equivalent resistance:\n\n   \\[\n   R_{eq} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{d+1}{d} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The equivalent resistance between the two blue vertices in an infinite grid of resistors, each with resistance \\( R = 1 \\), is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{d+1}{d} \\right)}\n   \\]"}

This will help prepare your skin for the subsequent products.\n\n2. **Paula\u2019s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply an exfoliant to gently remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. This step is crucial for smoother skin and better absorption of subsequent products.\n\n3. **IT Cosmetics CC+ Color Correcting Full Coverage Cream**: Apply your CC cream or foundation after exfoliating. This will provide coverage and additional skincare benefits, such as sun protection (SPF 50+).\n\n4. **Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**: Use a toner to help balance your skin's pH and prepare it for the next steps. This can also enhance the absorption of subsequent products.\n\n5. **Eucerin Sun Protection Photoaging Control Fluid SPF 50**: Finish with a sunscreen to protect your skin from UV damage. This step is essential for preventing sun-induced aging and maintaining healthy skin.\n\n### Product to Avoid in the Morning\n\nThe **Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner** is generally safe to use in the morning, but it's important to note that it might not be necessary if you have already cleansed your skin thoroughly with the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser. Some people might prefer to use a toner at night to remove any remaining impurities or if they have specific skin concerns that a toner addresses. However, if you feel your skin needs extra hydration or balancing after cleansing, you can certainly include it in your morning routine.\n\n### Summary of Morning Routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**\n2. **Paula\u2019s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**\n3. **IT Cosmetics CC+ Color Correcting Full Coverage Cream**\n4. **Optional: Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**\n5. **Eucerin Sun Protection Photoaging Control Fluid SPF 50**"}

Let's use Kruskal's algorithm for this problem.\n\nStep-by-step process:\n\n1. **Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.**\n2. **Pick the smallest edge and include it in the spanning tree if it does not form a cycle.**\n3. **Repeat the above step until the spanning tree has \\(n-1\\) edges (where \\(n\\) is the number of vertices).**\n\nHere is the list of edges sorted by their weights:\n\n- [1=2, 1]\n- [1=4, 2]\n- [2=5, 1]\n- [3=4, 2]\n- [4=5, 3]\n- [5=6, 2]\n- [6=4, 2]\n- [10=5, 3]\n- [2=3, \u221e]\n\nLet's construct the minimal spanning tree:\n\n1.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/clique", "generation": "To determine which edges are missing for the given graph to be a clique, we need to understand the definition of a clique in graph theory. A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent. In other words, a complete graph with \\(n\\) vertices is a clique.\n\nGiven the vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(1\\), and \\(2\\) in the graph, we need to check if any two vertices are not connected by an edge. The edges present in the graph are:\n\n- \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\n- \\(1 \\rightarrow 2\\)\n- \\(A \\rightarrow 1\\)\n- \\(A \\rightarrow 2\\)\n- \\(B \\rightarrow 1\\)\n- \\(B \\rightarrow 2\\)\n\nLet's list the pairs of vertices and check if there is an edge between each pair:\n\n1. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): There is an edge between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n2. \\(A\\) and \\(1\\): There is an edge between \\(A\\) and \\(1\\).\n3. \\(A\\) and \\(2\\): There is an edge between \\(A\\) and \\(2\\).\n4. \\(B\\) and \\(1\\): There is an edge between \\(B\\) and \\(1\\).\n5. \\(B\\) and \\(2\\): There is an edge between \\(B\\) and \\(2\\).\n6. \\(1\\) and \\(2\\): There is an edge between \\(1\\) and \\(2\\).\n\nSince there is an edge between every pair of vertices, the graph is already a clique. Therefore, no edges are missing for the graph to be a clique.\n\nThus, the answer is that no edges are missing."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/euler", "generation": "Yes, it is possible to find an Euler path in this graph. An Euler path visits every edge of a graph exactly once. For the graph depicted in the image, let's determine an Euler path step-by-step.\n\nGiven graph nodes:\n- A\n- B\n- C\n- D\n- E\n\nEdges:\n- A-B\n- B-C\n- C-D\n- D-E\n- E-A\n- A-E\n\nTo find an Euler path, we must ensure that each node has an even degree (number of edges). If any node had an odd degree, we would need to start and end the path at that node. In this case, all nodes have an even degree.\n\nHere is a possible Euler path:\n\n1. A-B\n2. B-C\n3. C-D\n4. D-E\n5. E-A\n6. A-E\n\nLet's break it down node-by-node:\n\n1. Start at node A.\n2. Take edge A-B to reach node B.\n3. Take edge B-C to reach node C.\n4. Take edge C-D to reach node D.\n5. Take edge D-E to reach node E.\n6. Take edge E-A to return to node A.\n7. Take edge A-E to reach node E.\n\nThis path visits each edge exactly once and covers all nodes.

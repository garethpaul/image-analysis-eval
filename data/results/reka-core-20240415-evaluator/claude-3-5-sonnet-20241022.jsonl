The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning.

Here is a recommended order for your morning routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**: Start by cleansing your face to remove any impurities and prepare your skin for the following products.\n\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply the exfoliant after cleansing. BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection. It can be used as a makeup base or on its own.\n\nYour morning skincare routine should typically avoid products that could increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight or that are best used when your skin is in repair mode, which is generally during the night.\n\nBased on the products you've shown:\n\n- Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant: While it is fine to use a BHA exfoliant in the morning, it's essential to follow up with sunscreen because BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine.

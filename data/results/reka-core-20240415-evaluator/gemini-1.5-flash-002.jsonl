The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Imagine baseball is like a really long game of tag, but instead of tagging someone, you hit a ball and run around bases!\n\nThere are two teams.

They try to catch the ball after the batter hits it, or get the batter *out* before they reach base.  They have different players for catching, throwing, and getting people out.\n\nThere are three ways to get a batter out:\n\n1. **Strike Outs:** The pitcher throws three bad pitches (called *strikes*) and the batter doesn't hit them.\n2. **Fly Outs:** The batter hits the ball high in the air, and a fielder catches it before it hits the ground.\n3. **Ground Outs:** The batter hits the ball on the ground, and a fielder catches it and throws it to a base before the batter gets there.\n\nEach team gets turns batting and fielding.

Here is a recommended order for your morning routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**: Start by cleansing your face to remove any impurities and prepare your skin for the following products.\n\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply the exfoliant after cleansing. BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection.

Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine.

Use this only 2-3 times a week, as over-exfoliation can irritate your skin.  It's best to do this at night, as it can increase sun sensitivity.\n\n3. **Serum/CC Cream:**  IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream. This is a color-correcting cream with SPF, so it works as both.

Here are the most likely causes:\n\n* **InPrivate Browsing (Incognito Mode):**  InPrivate mode in Microsoft Edge (and Incognito mode in other browsers like Chrome or Firefox) is specifically designed to prevent websites from storing cookies and other browsing data. This is for privacy reasons.  Once you close the InPrivate window, all cookies and browsing history from that session are deleted.\n\n* **Browser Settings:** Even outside InPrivate mode, you may have browser settings that restrict or block third-party cookies.  Websites often use third-party cookies for things like tracking user preferences or personalized ads.  If these are blocked, the website might not function as intended, including potentially losing your cookie data.\n\n* **Cleared Cookies and Cache:** You or a browser cleaning tool might have recently cleared your browsing data, including cookies and cache.

If it works in another browser, it points to a problem with your Edge browser's configuration.\n\n\nIf you've tried these steps and still experience the problem, it could be a more complex issue requiring more investigation.

Since one of the 5 cards is the Jack of hearts, only the Queen and King of hearts remain in the deck.

The brush described as a liner or rigger is actually a flat or bright brush based on its flat, wide shape. The round brush and the liner/rigger (correctly identified as such by the assistant) are correctly described. The confusion likely arises from the specific shapes and sizes of the brushes, which can sometimes be misleading without direct comparison.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nReasoning: While the assistant provides useful information about the general uses and characteristics of the brushes, the misidentification of one of the brushes reduces the accuracy of the response. A fully correct response would accurately label all three brushes, which is crucial for someone seeking specific information about watercolor brush types.\n\n"}

It's typically formed when the market experiences high volatility before continuing its original direction.\n\n2. **Pennant**: A Pennant is similar to a Flag but with less pronounced boundaries and usually smaller in size compared to the Flag. Like Flags, Pennants also represent a period of consolidation where prices move within narrower ranges before resuming the main trend.\n\nIn terms of trading signals, both flags and pennants can be used as buy signals if they appear at the end of an uptrend (as indicated by the arrows) because they suggest that sellers have become exhausted and buyers may take control again.\n\nThe key difference for traders would be whether these patterns appear during an uptrend or downtrend; if they're part of an existing upward momentum, one might consider them more reliable buy signals than if they were forming during a downtrend where other factors could influence their interpretation differently.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc4_f48a5df1c5e95688.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc4_f48a5df1c5e95688.jpg", "generation": "Both the flag and pennant are continuation patterns in technical analysis, meaning they suggest a pause in an existing trend before that trend resumes.

The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Imagine two teams playing tag on a big diamond shape.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/meme8", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "How can I use this meme, chat?", "reference": "This meme, featuring template \"Swole Doge vs Cheems,\" can be used in various online conversations to convey a sense of contrast or comparison between two things, much like the original \"Doge\" meme. The \"Swole Doge\" represents an exaggerated, muscular version of the Shiba Inu, often used to depict strength, confidence, or an overly serious approach. In contrast, \"Cheems,\" a more realistic depiction of a Shiba Inu, often represents a more relatable, down-to-earth, or less confident stance.\n\nHere are some ways you can use this meme in a conversation:\n\n1. **Strength vs. Vulnerability**: If someone shares a story about overcoming a challenge, you could respond with \"Swole Doge\" to represent their newfound strength. For a story about feeling vulnerable or facing difficulties, \"Cheems\" could be used to show empathy.\n\n2. **Seriousness vs. Playfulness**: If a conversation turns overly serious, you could use \"Swole Doge\" to represent the seriousness, followed by \"Cheems\" to lighten the mood and introduce a more playful tone.\n\n3. **Before vs. After**: In a fitness or self-improvement context, \"Cheems\" could represent the starting point, while \"Swole Doge\" could depict the goal or the results achieved after hard work.\n\n4. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If someone shares a picture of their ideal self or living space, followed by a picture of their current situation, you could use \"Swole Doge\" for the ideal and \"Cheems\" for the reality.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "generation": "This meme format, featuring the \"Buff Doge vs. Cheems\" or \"Swole Doge vs. Sad Doge,\" is used to compare two contrasting states, often humorous or relatable.  Here's how you can use it:\n\n* **Past vs. Present:**  Buff Doge represents a past, idealized version of yourself (e.g., \"Me at the beginning of summer break\" vs. Cheems as \"Me a week before school starts\").\n* **Expectation vs. Reality:**  Buff Doge embodies the expectation (e.g., \"What I thought adulting would be like\"), while Cheems shows the harsh reality (e.g., \"What adulting is actually like\").\n* **Skill Level:**  Buff Doge can represent someone highly skilled at something, and Cheems portrays a beginner (e.g., \"Professional Chef\" vs. \"Me trying to boil water\").\n* **Confidence vs. Insecurity:**  Buff Doge exudes confidence in a situation, while Cheems embodies the anxiety or self-doubt associated with it (e.g., \"Talking to my crush's dad\" – Buff Doge vs. Cheems).\n* **Before vs. After:** Buff Doge can be the \"before\" state (e.g., \"Before coffee\"), and Cheems the \"after\" (e.g., \"After a full day of work and no coffee\").\n* **Comparing Two Options:**  One option is strong and desirable (Buff Doge), while the other is weak or undesirable (Cheems).\n\n\nTo use it, simply label each Doge with the contrasting elements you want to compare.

Meaning:  Good things are coming, but be patient.\n* 許君一躍跳龍門 (xǔ jūn yī yuè tiào lóng mén):  Allowing you to leap through the Dragon Gate in a single bound. Meaning: You will achieve success dramatically and quickly when the time is right.  This refers to a Chinese legend where carp that leap over the Dragon Gate become dragons.  It signifies a major positive change in fortune and status.\n* 此卦鯨魚未得時 (cǐ guà jīng yú wèi dé shí): This fortune signifies the whale has not yet met its time.

BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection.

Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine.

This can be accidental or intentional.\n* **Privacy Settings:**  Browsers offer privacy settings that control how cookies are handled. Strict settings like \"Block all cookies\" or \"Block third-party cookies\" prevent websites from saving or accessing certain cookies.  The \"InPrivate\" mode you're using automatically deletes cookies when you close the window.\n* **Website Updates:**  Changes to the BBC website itself could affect how it handles cookies.

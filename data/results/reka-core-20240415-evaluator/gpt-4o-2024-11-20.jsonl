The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning.

BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines.

Let me know if the issue persists!", "score": 5, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response provides a comprehensive and step-by-step guide to troubleshoot internet connectivity issues on a cellphone, covering various potential causes such as Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi or Mobile Data being disabled, no active internet plan, network connection issues, wrong network settings, and Wi-Fi issues. The ground truth response specifically identifies that the airplane mode is on, which is one of the causes mentioned by the assistant. Therefore, the assistant response correctly addresses the ground truth and provides additional useful information.\n\nRating: 5\n\n"}

That suggests the scissors are about 17 cm in length.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_scissors_897e23cce259ee25.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_scissors_897e23cce259ee25.jpg", "generation": "The scissor in the photo seems to be approximately **130 mm (13 cm)** long, as per the measurement scale.", "score": 2, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response estimates the length of the scissors to be approximately 130 mm (13 cm), while the ground truth response measures the scissors to be about 17 cm (170 mm) long. There is a significant discrepancy between the two measurements, indicating that the assistant response does not correctly match the ground truth.\n\nRating: 2\n\nReasoning:\n- The assistant response provides a measurement that is significantly different from the actual measurement provided in the ground truth response.\n- A rating of 2 is given because the assistant response is not entirely incorrect; it provides a measurement in the correct unit (mm/cm), but the value itself is far off from the actual length.\n\n"}

Here are some potential causes and actions to identify and resolve the issue:\n\n### Electrical Issues:\n1. **Power Supply Issue**: \n   - Make sure the fan is plugged in securely.\n   - Check if the power outlet is functional by connecting another device.\n\n2. **Faulty Power Cord**:\n   - Inspect the power cord for visible damage.\n   - If damaged, the cord may need replacement.\n\n### Motor Overheating or Failure:\n3. **Overheated Motor**:\n   - If the fan ran continuously for a long time, the motor might have overheated. Let the fan cool down for about 30 minutes before attempting to turn it back on.\n\n4. **Burned-Out Motor**:\n   - If the fan motor has burned out, it may need to be replaced or repaired by a professional.\n\n### Mechanical Issues:\n5. **Blade Obstruction**:\n   - Check if something is obstructing the fan blades (e.g., debris or a misplaced object).\n   - Ensure the blades can spin freely by manually turning them (power off for safety).\n\n6. **Loose or Disconnected Wires**:\n   - If the fan’s wiring inside the unit is loose or disconnected, it may affect performance. \n\n### Control System:\n7. **Faulty Switch or Speed Control**:\n   - If the fan does not respond to the control buttons or remote, the switch or remote sensor might have failed.\n   - Test all available speed and power options.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider consulting the user manual or seeking help from the manufacturer or a professional repair technician.", "score": 3, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response provides a comprehensive list of potential reasons why a fan might stop working, covering electrical, mechanical, and control system issues. However, it does not specifically address the situation shown in the photo where a metal rod has jammed the fan blades. This scenario is a mechanical issue but is more specific and direct than the general mechanical issues mentioned in the response.\n\nRating: 3/5\nReason: The assistant response is generally helpful and covers a wide range of possible causes but misses the specific issue visible in the photo, which is a direct and immediate cause of the fan not working.\n\n"}

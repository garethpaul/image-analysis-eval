The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Okay!

The \"Swole Doge\" represents an exaggerated, muscular version of the Shiba Inu, often used to depict strength, confidence, or an overly serious approach. In contrast, \"Cheems,\" a more realistic depiction of a Shiba Inu, often represents a more relatable, down-to-earth, or less confident stance.\n\nHere are some ways you can use this meme in a conversation:\n\n1. **Strength vs. Vulnerability**: If someone shares a story about overcoming a challenge, you could respond with \"Swole Doge\" to represent their newfound strength. For a story about feeling vulnerable or facing difficulties, \"Cheems\" could be used to show empathy.\n\n2. **Seriousness vs. Playfulness**: If a conversation turns overly serious, you could use \"Swole Doge\" to represent the seriousness, followed by \"Cheems\" to lighten the mood and introduce a more playful tone.\n\n3. **Before vs. After**: In a fitness or self-improvement context, \"Cheems\" could represent the starting point, while \"Swole Doge\" could depict the goal or the results achieved after hard work.\n\n4. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If someone shares a picture of their ideal self or living space, followed by a picture of their current situation, you could use \"Swole Doge\" for the ideal and \"Cheems\" for the reality.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "generation": "This meme features two contrasting versions of the Shiba Inu dog: one muscular and confident, and the other sad or defeated.

For example, label the muscular dog as \"Going to a party\" and the sad dog as \"Getting rejected.\"\n\n3. **Comparing Aspirations**: The muscular dog can represent \"My goals\" while the sad dog can represent \"Reality.\"\n\n4. **Workout Memes**: The muscular dog can symbolize \"After a workout\" while the sad one could be \"Before the gym.\"\n\n5. **Everyday Situations**: Compare any two extremes in life, such as \"How I feel eating healthy vs. how I feel after a cheat day.\"\n\nFeel free to customize the captions to fit your context!", "score": 5, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response provides a comprehensive understanding of how the \"Swole Doge vs Cheems\" meme can be used in various contexts, effectively capturing the essence of the meme's contrast between two different states or attitudes.

The man is identified as Mark Zuckerberg, known for being the CEO and founder of Facebook, which owns Oculus, a company that produces VR headsets. The text \"A Drug Dealer Never Consumes!\" is a play on words that compares Zuckerberg (the 'drug dealer') to the VR technology (the 'drug'), suggesting that he is providing the 'drug' (VR technology) but not 'consuming' it himself.

Here is a recommended order for your morning routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**: Start by cleansing your face to remove any impurities and prepare your skin for the following products.\n\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply the exfoliant after cleansing. BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen.

Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine.

If you plan to use it in the morning, ensure you follow with sunscreen, as BHA can increase sun sensitivity.\n\n4. **CC Cream**: Next, use the **IT CC+ Cream** with SPF.

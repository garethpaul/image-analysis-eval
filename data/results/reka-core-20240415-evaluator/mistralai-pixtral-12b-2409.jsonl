The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Sure! Baseball is a fun sport that's played between two teams, usually on a big field with lots of green grass.

The players have different positions on the field: pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.\n\n2. **Scoring**: The goal is to score more runs than the other team. A run is scored when a player runs around all the bases and goes back to home plate.\n\n3. **Batting**: One team is at bat (hitting) while the other team is in the field. When you're at bat, you try to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher. If you hit the ball and make it to a base without the other team tagging you out, you get a hit.\n\n4. **Bases**: There are four bases on the field: home plate, first base, second base, and third base. You have to run from one base to the next to score a run.\n\n5. **Pitching**: The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter, who tries to hit it. The catcher, who sits behind the batter, catches the balls the batter doesn't hit.\n\n6. **Outs**: There are three ways to get an \"out\": \n   - The batter misses the ball three times.\n   - The batter hits the ball, but the other team catches it before it bounces.\n   - The ball is thrown to a base before the batter gets there, and the fielder tags the base with the ball before the batter steps on it.\n\n7. **Innings**: The game is divided into innings.

In contrast, \"Cheems,\" a more realistic depiction of a Shiba Inu, often represents a more relatable, down-to-earth, or less confident stance.\n\nHere are some ways you can use this meme in a conversation:\n\n1. **Strength vs. Vulnerability**: If someone shares a story about overcoming a challenge, you could respond with \"Swole Doge\" to represent their newfound strength. For a story about feeling vulnerable or facing difficulties, \"Cheems\" could be used to show empathy.\n\n2. **Seriousness vs. Playfulness**: If a conversation turns overly serious, you could use \"Swole Doge\" to represent the seriousness, followed by \"Cheems\" to lighten the mood and introduce a more playful tone.\n\n3. **Before vs. After**: In a fitness or self-improvement context, \"Cheems\" could represent the starting point, while \"Swole Doge\" could depict the goal or the results achieved after hard work.\n\n4. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If someone shares a picture of their ideal self or living space, followed by a picture of their current situation, you could use \"Swole Doge\" for the ideal and \"Cheems\" for the reality.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "generation": "This meme, known as the \"Doge\" meme, features two images of a Shiba Inu dog with a humorous and exaggerated caption.

Here are a few ways you can use this meme in a chat:\n\n1. **Irony**: Share the meme when something unexpected or ironic happens in a conversation. For example, if someone says they can't believe something, you can reply with the meme, implying that despite their disbelief, it's actually happening.\n\n2. **Humor**: Use the meme to lighten the mood or add some humor to a discussion. For instance, if someone is being overly dramatic, you can send the meme to poke fun at the situation.\n\n3. **Exaggeration**: Employ the meme when discussing something that's been blown out of proportion or is being exaggerated.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Symmetry:**\n   The infinite grid of resistors is symmetric, meaning any path from the blue vertex to another blue vertex can be mirrored to another path from a different blue vertex.\n\n2. **Path Analysis:**\n   By focusing on one specific path from one blue vertex to another, we can simplify the problem. Given the periodicity, the problem reduces to calculating the resistance along a specific path.\n\n3. **Simplify the Grid:**\n   The grid can be simplified by considering a smaller repeating unit (a 2x2 or 3x3 grid, for instance) and then extending the result to the infinite grid.\n\n4. **Calculate the Resistance:**\n   Using the formula for the equivalent resistance in a resistive grid, we can calculate the resistance between two points in the grid. For an infinite grid of resistors \\( R = 1 \\), the equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\) between two vertices separated by a distance \\( d \\) (in terms of the number of resistors) can be derived from known results in electrical engineering literature.\n\n   For an infinite square lattice of resistors with each resistor \\( R \\), the equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\) between two points separated by a distance \\( d \\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   R_{eq} \\approx \\frac{R}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{d+1}{d} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Here, \\( d \\) is the Manhattan distance between the two points.\n\n5. **Apply the Formula:**\n   For the given problem, \\( R = 1 \\).

Here is a recommended order for your morning routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**: Start by cleansing your face to remove any impurities and prepare your skin for the following products.\n\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply the exfoliant after cleansing. BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection.

Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine. Also, if you find that using an exfoliant every morning is too harsh for your skin, you might consider using it less frequently or applying it only in the evening.\n\nIf you experience any irritation or adverse reactions, discontinue use of the product and consult a dermatologist.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg", "generation": "To establish a proper morning skincare routine, you should typically follow a sequence that prepares your skin and protects it from environmental factors.

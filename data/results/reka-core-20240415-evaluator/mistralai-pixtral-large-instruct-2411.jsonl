Here's a summary of the key points from the manual:\n\n### Key Features and Functions:\n- **Edge Detection LED**: Lights up when the edge of a stud is detected.\n- **Power LED**: Indicates when the device is turned on.\n- **Activation Button**: Used to turn on the device and during calibration.\n- **Marking Notch**: A pencil notch to mark the edges of studs.\n\n### Operating Instructions:\n1. **Battery**: Use a 9-volt battery, connecting it by opening the back door of the unit.\n2. **Usage**:\n   - **Calibration**: Place the stud sensor flat against the surface, press and hold the activation button. The power and edge detection LEDs will light up. Once calibrated, keep holding the activation button during all procedures.\n   - **Scanning**: Slide the sensor slowly across the surface. When it detects a stud edge, the red LED will light up. Mark the stud edge using the pencil notch.\n   - **Finding the Stud Center**: Repeat the scanning process from the opposite direction to mark the other edge of the stud. The midpoint between the two marks indicates the stud center.\n\n### Operating Tips:\n- **Prevent Interference**: Keep your free hand at least 6 inches away from the unit while testing.\n- **Conventional Construction**: Doors and windows often have additional studs and headers. The sensor detects the edge of these as a single, wide stud.\n- **Surface Differences**: The sensor works on surfaces covered with wallpaper or fabric unless the coverings contain metallic foil or wires.\n- **Ceilings**: Use a piece of cardboard when scanning rough surfaces like spray ceilings to ensure best performance.\n\n### Cautions and Warnings:\n- **Electrical Wiring**: Be cautious as the sensor might detect electrical wiring or pipes as studs.\n- **Spacing**: Studs and joists are typically spaced 16 inches apart (406.4 mm) or 24 inches apart (609.6 mm) and are 1-1/2 inches (38 mm) wide.\n- **Safety**: Wear safety goggles and be aware of the proximity of electrical wiring or pipes.\n\n### Specifications:\n- **Depth Range**: Up to 3/4 inches (19 mm) through drywall.\n- **Accuracy**: The stud sensor is accurate to ±1/8 inches (3 mm) for wood and ±1/4 inches (6 mm) for metal.\n- **Shock and Water Resistance**: Can withstand up to a 3-foot (1 m) drop onto concrete and is water-resistant but not waterproof.\n- **Operating Temperature**: -20°F to +120°F (-29°C to +49°C).\n- **Storage Temperature**: -20°F to +150°F (-29°C to +66°C).\n\n### Limited Warranty:\n- Stanley offers a 2-year limited warranty for material and workmanship defects.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc17", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "describe the rule of this sport like I am 8 year old", "reference": "The sport being played in the image is baseball, which is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": " Sure! This sport is called baseball. Here are some basic rules to help you understand the game:\n\n1. **Teams and Players**: There are two teams, each with nine players. One team is on offense (batting) and the other is on defense (fielding).\n\n2. **Field**: The game is played on a field with four bases laid out in a diamond shape: home plate, first base, second base, and third base.\n\n3. **Objective**: The goal for the batting team is to hit the ball and run around the bases to score runs. The fielding team tries to get the batting team out by catching the ball in the air or getting the ball to a base before the runner.\n\n4. **Batting**: A player from the batting team stands at home plate and tries to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher from the fielding team. If the batter hits the ball, they run to first base.\n\n5. **Outs**: The fielding team can get the batter out in several ways:\n   - **Strikeout**: If the pitcher throws three strikes (a strike is a good pitch that the batter doesn't hit), the batter is out.\n   - **Fly Out**: If the batter hits the ball in the air and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground, the batter is out.\n   - **Ground Out**: If the batter hits the ball on the ground and a fielder throws it to a base before the runner gets there, the runner is out.\n\n6. **Innings**: The game is divided into innings. Each inning has two halves: the top and the bottom. In the top half, one team bats and the other fields. In the bottom half, they switch. There are usually nine innings in a game.\n\n7. **Scoring**: A run is scored when a player runs around all four bases and returns to home plate. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.\n\n8. **Fair Play**: Players must follow rules like not interfering with the batter or runner, and the umpire makes sure everyone plays fairly.\n\nThat's a simple way to understand baseball. It's a fun game to watch and play!", "score": 5, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response provides a clear and age-appropriate explanation of the rules of baseball, covering key aspects such as the objective of the game, how teams take turns batting and fielding, the role of bases, and how runs are scored.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/meme8", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "How can I use this meme, chat?", "reference": "This meme, featuring template \"Swole Doge vs Cheems,\" can be used in various online conversations to convey a sense of contrast or comparison between two things, much like the original \"Doge\" meme. The \"Swole Doge\" represents an exaggerated, muscular version of the Shiba Inu, often used to depict strength, confidence, or an overly serious approach. In contrast, \"Cheems,\" a more realistic depiction of a Shiba Inu, often represents a more relatable, down-to-earth, or less confident stance.\n\nHere are some ways you can use this meme in a conversation:\n\n1. **Strength vs. Vulnerability**: If someone shares a story about overcoming a challenge, you could respond with \"Swole Doge\" to represent their newfound strength. For a story about feeling vulnerable or facing difficulties, \"Cheems\" could be used to show empathy.\n\n2. **Seriousness vs. Playfulness**: If a conversation turns overly serious, you could use \"Swole Doge\" to represent the seriousness, followed by \"Cheems\" to lighten the mood and introduce a more playful tone.\n\n3. **Before vs. After**: In a fitness or self-improvement context, \"Cheems\" could represent the starting point, while \"Swole Doge\" could depict the goal or the results achieved after hard work.\n\n4. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If someone shares a picture of their ideal self or living space, followed by a picture of their current situation, you could use \"Swole Doge\" for the ideal and \"Cheems\" for the reality.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "generation": " This meme features two popular internet characters based on the Shiba Inu dog breed, often referred to as \"Doge\" or \"Cheems.\" The muscular version on the left is often used to represent strength, determination, or an exaggerated form of the character, while the one on the right, known as \"Cheems,\" is typically used to convey a sense of innocence, confusion, or curiosity.\n\nHere are a few ways you can use this meme:\n\n1. **Contrast**: Show a contrast between two states or situations. For example, you could use it to depict the difference between how you feel before and after a workout, or how you perceive a task before and after starting it.\n\n2. **Motivation**: Use the muscular Doge to represent motivation or inspiration. For example, you could caption it with something like \"Me after finally starting to exercise regularly\" vs. \"Me before starting to exercise.\"\n\n3. **Confusion vs. Clarity**: Use Cheems to represent a state of confusion or ignorance, and the muscular Doge to represent understanding or enlightenment. For example, \"Me trying to understand a complex topic\" vs. \"Me after finally getting it.\"\n\n4. **Humor**: Create a humorous contrast between two scenarios. For example, \"Me trying to open a jar of pickles\" vs. \"Me after finally opening it.\"\n\nTo use the meme effectively, add captions that fit the context of your joke or message.

However, based on the local position shown in the image, Black's main concern should be to secure the group and potentially reduce White's territory.\n\nHere are a few considerations for Black's optimal move:\n\n1. **Secure the Group**: Black's group in the center-left is currently surrounded by White stones.

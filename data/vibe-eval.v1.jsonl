Once your dough is prepared and shaped into a circle (use parchment paper if it's homemade), spread your tomato sauce on top leaving some space at the edge.

The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning.

The man is identified as Mark Zuckerberg, known for being the CEO and founder of Facebook, which owns Oculus, a company that produces VR headsets. The text \"A Drug Dealer Never Consumes!\" is a play on words that compares Zuckerberg (the 'drug dealer') to the VR technology (the 'drug'), suggesting that he is providing the 'drug' (VR technology) but not 'consuming' it himself. The metaphor is that drug dealers typically do not use their own drugs, and in the same vein, Zuckerberg, as a promoter or provider of VR technology, is not seen using it in this image.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme4_c31bf46338434a19.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme4_c31bf46338434a19.jpg"}

In contrast, \"Cheems,\" a more realistic depiction of a Shiba Inu, often represents a more relatable, down-to-earth, or less confident stance.\n\nHere are some ways you can use this meme in a conversation:\n\n1. **Strength vs. Vulnerability**: If someone shares a story about overcoming a challenge, you could respond with \"Swole Doge\" to represent their newfound strength. For a story about feeling vulnerable or facing difficulties, \"Cheems\" could be used to show empathy.\n\n2. **Seriousness vs. Playfulness**: If a conversation turns overly serious, you could use \"Swole Doge\" to represent the seriousness, followed by \"Cheems\" to lighten the mood and introduce a more playful tone.\n\n3. **Before vs. After**: In a fitness or self-improvement context, \"Cheems\" could represent the starting point, while \"Swole Doge\" could depict the goal or the results achieved after hard work.\n\n4. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If someone shares a picture of their ideal self or living space, followed by a picture of their current situation, you could use \"Swole Doge\" for the ideal and \"Cheems\" for the reality.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme8_74bfa0cddb33bf9e.png"}

BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection. It can be used as a makeup base or on its own.\n\nYour morning skincare routine should typically avoid products that could increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight or that are best used when your skin is in repair mode, which is generally during the night.\n\nBased on the products you've shown:\n\n- Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant: While it is fine to use a BHA exfoliant in the morning, it's essential to follow up with sunscreen because BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine. Also, if you find that using an exfoliant every morning is too harsh for your skin, you might consider using it less frequently or applying it only in the evening.\n\nIf you experience any irritation or adverse reactions, discontinue use of the product and consult a dermatologist.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg"}
